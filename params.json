If you want more tests feel free to send a\r\npull request.\r\n\r\nTesting is run as a part of the development server, and build tasks, however if\r\nyou wish to run just the tests use `grunt test`.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\nFor a more production ready build, with minified styles and scripts, you can use\r\n`grunt build`.\r\n\r\n### Play Nice\r\nWhere possible use an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) compatible editor/plugin.\r\n\r\n* Remove trailing whitespace from files.\r\n* Use ASCII filenames.\r\n* Run `grunt test` before commit and check for errors.\r\n\r\n**Do this all with ease!**\r\n\r\n\tmv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit\r\n\techo \"\\n# run grunt test before commit, abort if errors\\ngrunt test\" >> .git/hooks/pre-commit\r\n\r\n## License\r\n**Unless otherwise stated**\r\n\r\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,\r\nv. 2.0.
